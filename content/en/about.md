### ⌛️ About Maserhe

**jpg6** This is not my first website, but I hope it will be my last one to record some of my life, study and odd thoughts. First used the domain name maserhe before basing it on WordPress and placing it on my own personal server. The top was later moved to the domain name day1.cn. Finally, for the sake of stability and freedom, I decided to use Hugo to generate my own static web page, host it on GitHub and bind it to [jpg6.com](https://www.jpg6.com/zh/) domain name.

**jpg6** is named, jpg just corresponds to the first letter of the Chinese pinyin of the word "bundle", and 6 corresponds to slip. There is a saying that goes like this, either pack it up or pack it up, I might pack it up and run away. When talking about "original intention" or "meaning" when chatting with close friends, I always choose to escape. Even if I achieve some small worldly achievements, it is difficult to feel joy or satisfaction from the bottom of my heart. I always feel that everything is as insignificant as "fake". Meaningless. As I grow older and experience more, I wrote in another article [*Confessions of a 24-year-old: Pursuing meaning*](https://www.jpg6.com/zh/2020/06/06/yearly_review_23/) "*Perhaps thinking itself is the process of constructing meaning, which makes me no longer expect to have an epiphany in a certain moment, but just hope to move forward, experience and pursue my own life.*"

**jpg6** This name also means that you should no longer struggle with meaning, but should continue to learn, experience and challenge new things, and you can accept it happily even if you are judged as "changed" or "not like yourself".

I hope that in my spare time I can output more new knowledge and ideas, and write more output.
